# TSDB
TSDB is used to calculate the matrix profile (MP) of time series stored in relational DBMS. Tables are provided for storing MP and analytical primitives found on their basis.
The shell provides the user with the functionality of visualizing series, MP and analytical primitives found on their basis. TSDB is authored by Podsedov Maxim (mpodsedov@yandex.ru), Alexey Yurtin (iurtinaa@susu.ru) and Mikhail Zymbler (mzym@susu.ru), South Ural State University, Chelyabinsk, Russia.
